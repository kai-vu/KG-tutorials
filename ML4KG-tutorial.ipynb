While some work focuses on explanation for such models, alternative methods for link prediction exist, which are closer to the 'symbolic' world: rule miners. They come in different flavors, but in general they try to discover rules (of the type body -> head) that capture patterns in the data.\n",

You can try to compare the different performances of mined rules and embedding methods in any of the above datasets."
